        ### Thank you for your suggestion!

        We appreciate everyone's contribution. However, before you continue,
        please take a moment to check if your suggested spritepack:
        - is public (available by a public link; not 'DM me for link') or its
          author (*every* author if there are multiple) allows sharing it publicly
        - has no NSFW content (e.g. explicit naked Monika's body)
        - has no offensive content (e.g. hate symbols, hate speech, etc.)

        > [!NOTE]
        > While we respect your choice of entered spritepack name/tags/authors,
        > we will also check the spritepack content and correct how we see it fit.
        > Thank you for understanding.
