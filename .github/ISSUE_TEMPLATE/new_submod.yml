        ### Please take a moment to read 📗

        We appreciate everyone's contribution. However, before you continue,
        please take a moment to check if your suggested submod:
        - is public (available by a public link; not 'DM me for link') or its
          author (*every* author if there are multiple) allows sharing it publicly
        - has no NSFW content (e.g. explicit naked Monika's body, or adult topics)
        - has no offensive content (e.g. hate symbols, hate speech, etc.)

        > [!TIP]
        > You have more than one spritepack/submod on your mind? Please create
        > a separate issue for each of them using appropriate forms.

        > we will also check the submod content and correct how we see it fit.
        > Thank you for understanding.
